  <h1>LETS PLAY PIG!</h1>
  <ul>
    <p>For those of you new to the game the rules are simple.</p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to get at or over 100 points before the other player does.</p>
    <li>You get points by taking turns. In each turn, you repeatedly roll a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player passes and scores the sum of the rolls from that turn(i.e. the turn total).</li>
    <li>At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two options:
      roll - If the player rolls a 1: the player scores nothing for the turn and it becomes the next player's turn.
      roll any other number: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
      pass - The turn total is added to the player's total score and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins the game!</li>
  </ul>
